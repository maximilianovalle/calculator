## Lessons Learned:

This project was the final stepping stone in completing the Odin Project's fundamentals section, and as such, it provided me with a lot of challenges I had to research and work past.

My biggest issue were logic errors. Working on the buttons individually (number input, positive/negative symbol, operator inputs, etc.) and combining their logic would provide me with unforseen issues I had to figure out. I'm sure there's an easier way of meshing different functions as they're being developed independently - maybe spending more time thoroughly planning the logic behind each one was the solution - but doing it in the way I did provided me with an opportunity to work through my code step by step to figure out where the errors lay.

Layout was also something I struggled with. Specifically getting the numbers in the screen display to start on the right side, extend to the left, and hide their overflow on the left. I kept finding out new ways to type backwards, right to left, overflow, etc. - I was essentially able to find a way to do everything to my text but the one thing I wanted it to do. And when I finally figured out how to get my numbers to display the way I wanted them to, it was infuriatingly simple. Only three lines of code in the right spots!

A new technique I tried out when creating this calculator was getting the layout of all my features down first before I ever touched the logic. Having my dummy calculator ready and looking nice made testing out the numbers and logic a way more pleasant experience, and it made me more confident in approaching the actual logic since I had already completed a hurdle.
